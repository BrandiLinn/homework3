Homework 3
==========

1. Clone this repository. See the instructions in Week 1 for details: <https://github.com/aipdx-wdim387/week1>.
2. In your copy of this repository, create a subdirectory. Name the subdirectory with your name (for example: danmuzyka).
3. Visit the tutorial [Building a Web App From Scratch in AngularJS](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/building-a-web-app-from-scratch-in-angularjs/).
4. Download all of the source files from the top of the tutorial, and save them into the directory you created in the cloned copy of this repository.
5. As you work through the tutorial, edit the files per the instructions. However you MUST add your own comments to the code, explaining what is going on in your own words. If you are not sure you understand, add comments such as "I'm not sure what is happening here, but I think it might be..." The point is that you make an effort to understand it. You must add at least one comment for each block of code in the tutorial to get full credit.
6. When you complete the tutorial and have added your comments, commit the files and push to GitHub.
7. Send a pull request to the original copy of this repository.
8. If you get really stuck trying to submit this over Git, put all of the files related to the tutorial into a ZIP file and send me the ZIP file over e-mail: danmuzyka.ai@gmail.com.
